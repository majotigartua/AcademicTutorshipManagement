# AcademicTutorshipManagement
The Academic Tutorship Management System is a software product that will provide end users the necessary tools for the management of Academic Tutorship Reports, academic tutorship sessions, academic problems and follow-up of academic problems, academic tutors and students, and of professors and educative experiences, allowing the time and effort currently invested in the manual execution of tutorship activities to be used for the attention provided to university students at the Universidad Veracruzana.
